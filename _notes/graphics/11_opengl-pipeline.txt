history:
  - fixed-function pipeline [legacy]
  - programmable pipeline (shaders)


vertex specification
  -> [vertex shader]
    -> [tesselation unit]
      -> [geometry shader]
        -> [rasterizer]
          -> [fragment shader]
            -> final frame

pipeline:
  > an input buffer is set up containing vertex data and other attributes
  > GPUs have a number of "shader cores" that run in parallel
  > each shader core gets a piece of the vertex buffer and computes an output
  > the output of one shader may be passed to the next stage of the pipeline
