pipeline:
  > An input buffer is set up containing vertex data and other attributes
  > GPUs have a number of "shader cores" that run in parallel
  > Each shader core gets a piece of the vertex buffer and computes an output
  > The output of one shader may be passed to the next stage of the pipeline
