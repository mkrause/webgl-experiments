vector: [w/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics)] [w/Euclidean_vector] [w/Coordinate_vector]
  > (note: we will assume real-valued *coordinate vectors* here, since the context is computer graphics)
  > an n-dimensional *vector* is an element of R^n (i.e. a tuple of n real numbers)

operations:
  > note: for convention we will use letters a, b, c, d for vectors, and p, q, r, s for scalars
  - magnitude (or "length"): |a|
    > e.g. for a = (p, q), |a| = sqrt(p^2 + q^2)
  - scalar multiplication: sa (where s is a scalar)
  - normalize: â = a / |a|
  - vector addition: a + b
  - vector subtraction: a - b (note: this is the same as `a + (-1 * b)`, which uses scalar multiplication)
  - dot product
  - cross product

dot product (or: scalar product, inner product): [w/Dot_product]
  > given a = (p, q), b = (r, s)
  > the dot product a⋅b = pr + qs (note that the result is a scalar)
  > uses:
    - scalar projection
      > see https://youtu.be/fjOdtSu4Lm4?list=PLImQaTpSAdsArRFFj8bIfqMk2X7Vlf3XF&t=8438
      > given a vector b, and a normalized vector â, â⋅b gives the length of b projected along the direction â
      > i.e. we can use this to project any vector along some axis/direction

cross product: [w/Cross_product]
  > takes two vectors and produces another vector, denoted a × b

matrix: [w/Matrix_(mathematics)]
  > a *matrix* is a 2-dimensional array of numbers
  > notation:                             ⎡1 2 3⎤
    > written as a table of numbers, e.g. ⎣4 5 6⎦
    > a matrix has a *size* `<rows>x<cols>` specifying the number of rows and columns (pronounced "<rows> by <cols>")
      > the number of rows and columns are called the *dimensions* of the matrix
      > note that unlike vectors (which have a single dimension `n`), matrices have two dimensions (`i` and `j`)
    > a matrix is usually named with an uppercase letter (e.g. A), and its elements with a lowercase (e.g. `a_i,j`)
    > indexing is done first by row, then by column, denoted `A[i,j]` or by element using `a_i,j`
    > we can denote "slicing" of a matrix to get the i-th row or j-th column as `A[i,*]` or `A[*,j]`, respectively
  > semantic interpretation:
    > a matrix on its own is just a data structure (table of numbers), it doesn't specify any kind of semantics
    > in particular, it does not have a preference for either rows->columns or columns->rows as a hierarchy
      > this is on purpose, because the same matrix may be used for either the rows or columns-first interpretation
    > in computers however, we must make a choice because computer memory is inherently linear (and so is written code)
  > row-major vs column-major: [w/Row-_and_column-major_order]
    > we can linearize a matrix in two ways:
      - row-major order: a column of rows
      - column-major order: a row of columns
      > the natural way to represent a matrix in code is in row-major order, because this matches written text order
      >  in OpenGL: see "A special case would be OpenGL" in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Row-_and_column-major_order
        > https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33862730/row-major-vs-column-major-confusion
  > types of matrices:
    - the 0x0 matrix is called the *empty* matrix
    - a 1x1 matrix is equivalent to a scalar
    - a matrix with a single row is a called a *row matrix*
    - a matrix with a single column is a called a *column matrix*
    - an nxn matrix (equal rows and columns) is called a *square* matrix
  > relation to vectors:
    > a vector is not a matrix, but it can be identified with a row or column matrix with the same values
    > by default, vectors are usually considered as column matrices (but it can adapt based on the desired operation)
    > such a row/column matrix will also be called a *row/column vector* (depending on the context)
  > matrix as a list of vectors:
    > a common use of matrices is to serve as a list of vectors, e.g. A = [u v w]
      > in particular, these will usually be *coordinate vectors* from the same *vector space* [w/Coordinate_vector]
    > by convention, the vectors are placed as columns in the matrix
    > thus, we can interpret the matrix in this case as a "vector of vectors" (row vector of column vectors)
    > the rows can be interpreted as a list of *coordinates* on the respective basis
      > for this reason, we sometimes speak of "vector-major" and "coordinate-major" instead of row/column-major

matrix operations:
  - transpose, denoted A^T
  - scalar addition/multiplication (element-wise)
  - matrix addition (element-wise)
  - matrix multiplication
  - inverse (if invertible)

linear transformations: [w/Linear_map]
  > ref: 3Blue1Brown [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE]
  > a *linear transformation* `T` is a mapping `V → W` from n-dim vector space `V` to m-dim vector space `W` such that:
    - the operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication are preserved
    > also called a *linear map*
  > properties:
    - a linear transformation always maps the origin of `V` to the origin in `W`
    - all lines remain lines (cf. https://youtu.be/kYB8IZa5AuE?t=166)
  > if `V` and `W` are finite spaces with a basis defined for each, then we can describe all linear transformations
    with an mxn matrix `A`
  > any linear transformation can be described by a matrix (assuming V, W are finite and a basis is defined for each):
    > (given `V` n-dimensional and `W` m-dimensional, this will be an mxn matrix `A`)
    - start by taking the basis vectors of `V` and putting it in a matrix (with the basis vectors as column vectors):
      [i j k ...] (nxn)
    - now map each of these basis vectors to their images in `W`:
      [T(i) T(j) T(k) ...] (mxn)
      > note that these are n (m-dimensional) vectors in `W`
      > these n vectors can be considered our new basis vectors in `W`
      > however, note that if n < m, we don't span the entire space, and if n > m, there are redundant basis vectors
    - this mxn matrix now captures the entire linear transformation
  > general idea:
    - all coordinate vectors are linear combinations of some basis vectors
      > thus, all coordinate vectors are fully specified by the basis vectors + coordinates
    - we first map the basis vectors to new (potential) basis vectors in `W`
      > note: these new basis vectors may not be linearly dependent, and there may be redundant basis vectors
    - each coordinate vector in `V` is then mapped by "changing basis" to the new ones in `W`
      > i.e. we keep the same coordinates but change the bases, giving us a new linear combination in `W`
  > example: given 2-dim `V` and 3-dim `W`, and let `v` = [x, y]
    - construct the matrix `A` = [T(i) T(j)] for i,j basis vectors in `V`
    - T(v) then becomes the linear combination `x * T(i) + y * T(j)` in `W`
    - if we write this out in full, the resulting 3-vector becomes:
      ⎡x * T(i)_1 + y * T(j)_1⎤
      ⎢x * T(i)_2 + y * T(j)_2⎥
      ⎣x * T(i)_3 + y * T(j)_3⎦
  > alternatively, in a more algorithmic (but less enlightening) approach:
    - take the dot product of the first row of `T` and `v`: `T[1,*] ⋅ v`, this becomes the first entry in `T(v)`
    - repeat for all `m` rows until you have an m-dimensional vector `T(v)` in `W`
  > we can *compose* two transformation matrices through an operation called *matrix multiplication* (see below)
  > it turns out that we can make this work for the vector mapping operation as well if we consider `v` a column matrix:
    `T(v) := Tv`
  > in the special case that `V` and `W` are the same dimension, this transformation represents a change of basis
    > see [w/Change_of_basis]

  > recall that we can describe a linear transformation `T` as `Ax` (for `A` a matrix and `x` a vector)
    > this takes an mxn-matrix and an n-vector and produces an m-vector
  > we can generalize a bit to operate not just on one vector `x`, but a list of `p` vectors at the same time
    > (this will become useful when we discuss composition of transformations below)
    > this new operation takes an mxn-matrix and an nxp-matrix (p n-vectors) and produces an mxp-matrix
    > as before when we defined linear transformation matrices, the p n-vectors will be the columns of the matrix
  > motivation: given `Ax`
    > if we repeat this process with another transformation matrix `B` we get `B(Ax)`
    > it turns out that matrix multiplication is associative, thus we can rewrite this as `(BA)x`
    > intuitively, we are applying `B` to all the basis vectors (columns) in `A`, producing a new transformation

examples of linear transformations in 2D:
  > see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AheaTd_l5Is
  - identity: I
  - scaling:  ⎡s_x  0 ⎤ (i.e. the identity matrix, but with 1 replaced by the corresponding factor)
              ⎣ 0  s_y⎦ (if any factor is negative, then we get a reflection)
  - shearing: ⎡ 1  h_x⎤
              ⎣h_y  1 ⎦
  - rotation: ⎡ s  -h ⎤ ~ ⎡cos(a) -sin(a)⎤ (combination of shearing in x and y, in equal but opposite amounts)
              ⎣ h   s ⎦   ⎣sin(a)  cos(a)⎦ (in particular, to rotate at angle `a`, `h` = `sin(a)`)
    > shearing also increases the size, so we need to compensate by scaling by `s` = `cos(a)` to counteract

examples of linear transformations in 3D:
  > see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AheaTd_l5Is
  - identity: I
  - scaling:  ⎡s_x  0   0 ⎤
              ⎢ 0  s_y  0 ⎥
              ⎣ 0   0  s_z⎦
  - shearing: ⎡ 1   h_xy  h_xz⎤ (in 3D there are six ways to shear, these cover all the remaining entries)
              ⎢h_yx  1    h_yz⎥
              ⎣h_zx h_zy   1  ⎦
  - rotation: ⎡cos(a) -sin(a)    0   ⎤ (we can combine the six shears to form rotations, one for each of three axes)
    (along Z) ⎢sin(a)  cos(a)    0   ⎥ (note that this (Z) rotation corresponds exactly to the 2D case)
              ⎣  0       0       1   ⎦ (in essence, in 2D we can only rotate along the (hypothetical) Z axis)
  - rotation: ⎡cos(a)    0     sin(a)⎤
    (along Y) ⎢  0       1       0   ⎥
              ⎣-sin(a)   0     cos(a)⎦
  - rotation: ⎡  1       0       0   ⎤
    (along X) ⎢  0     cos(a) -sin(a)⎥
              ⎣  0     sin(a)  cos(a)⎦
  > the three rotations (Z, Y, X) are also called yaw, pitch, and roll, respectively

matrix transformations: [w/Transformation_matrix]
  > ref: [5min-Affine] "Affine transformations in 5 minutes" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AheaTd_l5Is
  > we have seen that matrices can represent linear transformations
    > these include scaling and shearing (and rotation, which is a combination of both, see [5min-Affine])
  > linear transformation however cannot represent certain other important transformations like:
    - translation (this violates the "origin gets mapped to the origin" principle)
    - projective transformations (violates the "straight lines remain straight lines" principle)
  > matrix transformations *can* however, describe some non-linear transformations if we go a dimension higher
    > in particular, we can represent the following as linear transformations in R^n+1:
      - translation, through affine transformation matrices [w/Affine_transformation]
      - projections, through projective transformation matrices [w/Homography]
  > for example, in 3D space, we can use a 4x4-matrix, and we must add a 4th coordinate to our input vector
    - using the additional coordinate (`w` for 3D) is called *homogeneous coordinates* [w/Homogeneous_coordinates]
    - the 4x4-matrix is also called an *augmented matrix* [w/Augmented_matrix]
  > affine transformations (translation): [w/Affine_transformation]
    > see [5min-Affine] for a great visual on how translation in 2D is a shear in 3D
    - to implement an affine transformation, we augment the matrix with another column containing the translation vector
    - we also add one more row containing [0 0 ... 1]
    - the input vector must have an additional coordinate of 1 (homogeneous coordinates)
      > conveniently, we can set this coordinate to 0 if we want to "turn off" the translation and get a linear tf.
    - the resulting vector again has an addition coordinate of 1, which we can ignore
  > projective transformations: [w/Homography]
    > affine transformations are a special case of *projective transformations*
    > in the general case of projective transformations, the last row in the matrix need not be [0 0 ... 1]

examples of projective transformations in 3D:
  - translation:  ⎡1  0  0  t_x⎤
                  ⎢0  1  0  t_y⎥
                  ⎢0  0  1  t_z⎥
                  ⎣0  0  0   1 ⎦
  - projection:   ⎡?⎤ TODO
                  ⎢?⎥
                  ⎢?⎥
                  ⎣?⎦
